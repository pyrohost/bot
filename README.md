HAZMAT: Not up to current standards of code quality. 💀

This project has sinned in every conceivable way, it uses:

- a json database
- rwlock HEAVEN
- half-assed task scheduling
- no proper error handling EXCEPT IN THE COMMANDS
- NO LOGGING BECAUSE WHY NOT
- a bunch of global variables
- *almost* centralized state :)
- what the fuck is a box
- probably a lot more

good luck reading this code, it's a mess. - ellie
