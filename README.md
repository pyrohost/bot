HAZMAT: Not up to current standards of code quality. ðŸ’€

This project has sinned in every conceivable way, it uses:

- ~~a json database~~ SQLITE <3
- rwlock HEAVEN
- half-assed task scheduling
- no proper error handling EXCEPT IN THE COMMANDS
- NO LOGGING BECAUSE WHY NOT
- a bunch of global variables
- *almost* centralized state :)
- probably a lot more

good luck reading this code, it's a mess. - ellie
I LOVE SQLITE, I HATE ORM - muki
